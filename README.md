# VERSION
Latest stable version: v2.0 (24-02-2019)

# CHANGE LOGS

I think the project can be extended in the future as i have ideas for new features.
The target is to create software with many features, yet very easy to use because of keyboard binds and clear, basic interface

I'm also open for every suggestion.
