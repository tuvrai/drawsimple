= INSTRUCTIONS =
*ESC - breaks current drawing (before putting it onto canvas)
*SHIFT - when held, it inverts colors
*CTRL - when held, it blocks shape drawing
*mousewheel - increases/decreases drawing width (except while holding ctrl to allow website size change)
*RMB
	- figures (square,triangle,circle) - draws with secondary color background
	- pencil, line - inverts color


#Color picker - LMB - changes first color, RMB - second color; background is ignored (it should return black (#000000) color)
#Downloading image - background is ignored, as preffered extension is PNG it should be transparent.

== FUTURE ==
I think the project can be extended in the future as i have ideas for new features.
The target is to create software with many features, yet in a very simple interface, strongly using keyboard.

== TODO ==
	#BUGS TO FIX
		*At normal drawing, while holding button you mouseout from canvas and come back holding the button whole time, the 'unexpected' line is drawn
	#FEATURES
		*Elipses aren't perfectly rounded.
